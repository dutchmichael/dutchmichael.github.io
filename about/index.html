<br>		
<p>	In 1979, I learned BASIC programing on a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 1, thanks to Professor Jim Frogge, Bishop MacNamara High School.

<p> In 1983, at Eastern Illiniois University I wrote my first FORTRAN program using IBM punch cards. Yes, I numbered my cards, and yes, I played IBM punchcard pick-up.

<p>In 1984, still at Eastern Illinois University I started using an IBM Model 5150 Personal Computer

<p>During my 1984 Christmas Break my dad, who worked for AT&T brought home this manual, I read it, took a bunch of notes in a spiral notebook, learned how to batch program, and used that notebook for years.

<p> In 1987, after graduating from Eastern Illinois Univesity, and while a Lieutenant in the United States Army, I purchased my first computer, a Commodore PC 10-2. It had a monitor with two 5-1/4 inch floppy drives, and cost $1200. I perfected my MS_DOS batch programming using this computer.
